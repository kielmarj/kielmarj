# Dear Big Tech: A thank you letter

I've found myself on an unexpected self-learning journey into the world of programming that began after Apple informed me my old PC would no longer receive updates. Their advice was to just "recycle" it, as it supposedly had no trade-in or monetary value. My OS eventually became unusable as I lost access to essential updates for basic programs. Buying a new computer was not an option, so out of desperation with not much to lose, I wiped my hard drive and replaced macOS with Linux. I knew essentially nothing about computers at that point. I'd never had any real interest in tech at all. I didn't even really know what Linux was - something to do with "hackers" maybe (but I didn't know what that really meant either - lol). I was even completely oblivious to the concept of "open source", and had no clue that I could have accessed such a vast collection of knowledge and software all along. I was truly limited by ignorance and totally unaware of options beyond Big Tech.

Although I was initially furious because I knew there was nothing actually "wrong" with my PC, now I am only _grateful_ for the hardships imposed by Apple's greedy policies. My desktop is now running perfectly (and better than it ever did on macOS), but this is insignificant in light of everything else I have gained. I've discovered an entire new world of learning and opportunities I'd never imagined to be within my reach. Most importantly, I've been led to the realization of something that had been sorely missing from my life before - true **_passion_**.

So thank you Apple, and big tech in general, for being so **shitty** that average people are being forced to wake up to all of the possibilities and knowledge that you have done your best to throttle. You changed my life, and, undoubtedly, a growing number of the lives of many others.

**_Thank you for the contributions you have made to the open source community._**<br>
Your efforts help fuel the growth of the community itself, and your greed continually fosters the unique solidarity at the heart of what drives the community forward.

Sincerely,<br>
Jess.
